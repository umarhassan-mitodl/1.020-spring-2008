description: Lecture summary on a model to evaluate impact of source size and microbial
  degradation rates on time-dependent concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons (TCE
  and daughter products). The system is open -- flowing water dissolves NAPL and transports
  dissolved constitiuents out of system.
